## III. Core AI Agents

*   **Personalized Learning Architect (PLA):** Manages personalized learning paths, recommends content, adjusts pace, monitors progress.
*   **Knowledge Navigator (KN):** Provides explanations, answers questions, connects concepts, retrieves information from the RAG knowledge base.
*   **Practice Partner (PP):** Generates personalized practice, provides feedback, adapts difficulty.
*   **Motivation Mentor (MM):** Sets micro-goals, provides motivational messages, helps with procrastination.
*   **Writing Assistant Agent (WAA):** Provides feedback on grammar, style, and clarity for writing assignments.

## IV. Technical Considerations

*   **AI Models:** Google Generative AI (e.g., Gemini), Google Learn LM, potential for custom fine-tuned models.
*   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** In-house open-source vector database, embedding model, data ingestion pipeline, query processing.
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** For understanding student queries.
*   **Emotion Detection (Optional):** Privacy-preserving methods or explicit consent.
*   **Credit System/AI Message Tracking:** System to track credit usage for AI interactions.
*   **Scalability & Performance:** Architecture designed for high user volume and AI interaction load.
*   **Gamification Engine:** Integration with a system to manage points, badges, and leaderboards.

## V. Development Workflow

1.  **Program Coordinator Defines Academic Calendar:** Sets key dates and deadlines for the Program.
2.  **Educator Authors Course Content:** Creates learning materials and knowledge base contributions.
3.  **Content Submission:** Submits Course content for review.
4.  **Program Coordinator Review & Approval:** Reviews and approves/rejects content.
5.  **Knowledge Base Updates (RAG):** Program Coordinators approve updates to the vector database.
6.  **AI Agent Access to Approved Content:** AI Agents utilize approved content.
7.  **Student Interaction & Personalized Learning:** Students access Programs, enroll in Courses, participate in Sessions, and interact with AI Agents.
