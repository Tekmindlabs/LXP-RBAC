### Development Standards
```typescript
interface DevelopmentStandards {
  codeQuality: {
    typescript: true;
    eslint: true;
    prettier: true;
  };
  testing: {
    jest: true;
    cypress: true;
    rtl: true;
  };
  documentation: {
    swagger: true;
    storybook: true;
  };
}
```

### Key Features Per Role
```typescript
interface RoleFeatures {
  programCoordinator: {
    programManagement: true;
    teacherAssignment: true;
    analytics: true;
  };
  teacher: {
    classManagement: true;
    grading: true;
    aiAssistant: true;
  };
  student: {
    learningTools: true;
    progressTracking: true;
    aiCompanion: true;
  };
  parent: {
    progressMonitoring: true;
    communication: true;
    notifications: true;
  };
}
```

### Critical Path Dependencies
```typescript
const criticalPath = {
  week1: ['RBAC', 'Authentication', 'Database'],
  week2: ['Programs', 'Classes', 'Users'],
  week3: ['AI', 'Learning', 'Assessment'],
  week4: ['Portals', 'Integration', 'Deploy']
};
```

### Quality Assurance Focus
```typescript
interface QAFocus {
  performance: {
